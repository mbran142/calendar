Potential todo list for my calendar project
- Add a small graphic for each button on the year panel, so it depends on the density of events in the months of that year
- Add several hover-over options for buttons and such
- Add hotkeys for everthing
- Add focus listeners for stuff (research this)
- make it so you can add monthly or weekly things that depend on weekday (remember i would have to modify the loaded panel list accordingly when changing these)
- after 6), make a generateDefaultFile() function
- Add a color changing option
- Change the color of generated panels if it's today's date
